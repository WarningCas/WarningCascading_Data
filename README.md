Warning Cascading Data

Tools:
We used GumTree, SCALe, and Hydrogen to analysis the warnings generated by static analysis tool.

GumTree: https://github.com/GumTreeDiff/gumtree

SCALe: https://github.com/cmu-sei/SCALe/tree/scaife-scale

Hydrogen: https://github.com/iowastateuniversity-programanalysis/hydrogen

The warnings that Static analysis tool directly generated is save at [Warning_Cascading](https://github.com/WarningCas/WarningCascading_Data/tree/master/real-word-set-result).

The we have the real-word result saved in the [real-world-set-result](https://github.com/WarningCas/WarningCascading_Data/tree/master/warnings_sqlite).

The table we used to record the running result of each tool is Experiments_result.xlsx
