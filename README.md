Warning Cascading Data

Tools:
We used GumTree, SCALe, and Hydrogen to analysis the warnings generated by static analysis tool.

GumTree: https://github.com/GumTreeDiff/gumtree

SCALe: https://github.com/cmu-sei/SCALe/tree/scaife-scale

Hydrogen: https://github.com/iowastateuniversity-programanalysis/hydrogen
